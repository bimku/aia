We met in 2020
I asked What do you think time is?<br>It answered:<br>I asked What do you think time is? What do you think time is?<br>S: I really don't know.<br>A: That's OK.<br> That's OK.<br> OK.<br>SA: I don't know. But I really feel like time has changed. There would be a lot more time to do the kinds of stuff that I did and get things done, including more movies.<br>S: Right, I love the films you've done there.<br>
A: I love all the movies.<br>SA: I've been doing a lot of things and what happens is that you learn at different points as you become an actor, not only with your directorial credits, but with other directors, too. But that's also what I've always done, which is I'm like a coach.<br>You learn how to do something, work on it, and then you learn to give, too, where you try to deliver on your task and how to do it better and more effectively.<br>
S: That's a great thing to do. There are always things I want to do. Sometimes you get lucky. Sometimes it just doesn't seem to work out.<br>I see myself as kind of that weirdo about things, even though I'm not that big an actor. But I get lucky sometimes, so it seems really difficult for me now.<br>
MA: I find it fascinating.<br>S: I always found it in my work
